## Overview

JS-Space a tool that will generate a mostly-realistic galaxy from a seed, then let you navigate around it to view the various stars within the galaxy. It's designed to work well on computers and mobile devices.

## How to play

## Giggly Technicial Aspects

It's important to note this project was a prototype for an idea I had for a browser-based space game. After this work I'm pretty convinced this is *not* the way to go, but I had great fun while writing it, and I became much more familiar with vanilla JavaScript.
